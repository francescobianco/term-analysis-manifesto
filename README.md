# Term Analysis Manifesto

## Introduction

Welcome to the Term Analysis Manifesto! This manifesto outlines the principles of term analysis in software development, emphasizing the importance of using consistent and domain-specific terms within codebases. 

## Principles

### 1. Glossary-Driven Development

   - Software source code must contain terms derived from a glossary, which should always be distributed alongside the source code, much like software licenses.

### 2. Domain-Driven Design

   - Every software project inherently belongs to a specific application domain. Terms used in development should be derived from and aligned with this domain.

### 3. Software Engineering Fundamentals

   - Adherence to fundamental software engineering principles, such as modularity, maintainability, and scalability, remains essential in all development efforts.
